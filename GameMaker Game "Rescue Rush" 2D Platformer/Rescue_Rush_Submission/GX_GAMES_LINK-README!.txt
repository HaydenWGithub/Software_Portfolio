######GAME SUBMISSION####

Since GameMaker requires a license in order to export 
the game as an executable, I've opted for the free alternative,
hosting the game on GX.games using a private link.

The Game can be accessed using the below link:

Note: This game is NOT procedurally generated like other runners. This game
does indeed have a finish line and unique areas of the game, I would encourage
you to try and finish the game (it can get difficult!) in order to see all
the hard work.

Our team only contains one programmer, one level designer, and two visual artists.
This game is quite simple, although it gets strangely addicting after a while.
