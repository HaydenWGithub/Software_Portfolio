Spike: Spike_No10
Title: emergent group behaviour

Author: Hayden Whiteford, 104001272

Goals/Deliverables: [CODE] + [SPIKE REPORT]
Create a group agent steering behaviour simulation that is able to demonstrate distinct modes of emergent group behaviour. In particular, the simulation must:
• Include cohesion, separation and alignment steering behaviours
• Include basic wandering behaviours
• Use a weighted-sum to combine all steering behaviours
• Support the adjustment of parameters for each steering force while running
• Spike outcome report and working code (with key instructions).

Technologies, Tools, and Resources used:
pyglet
python
xcode
…

Tasks undertaken: 
- created three different modes:
	- separate: sets an agent to a random path separate from the group (ie. just the wander() function)
	- cohere: finds an agent's surrounding neighbours, and creates a weighted-sum of all of their steering forces to use for the agent's force
	- align: uses the cohere mode function as a base, but also adds in the position of the the agent so that the steering force is biased toward the centre of a neighbor group, resulting in a straight line of agents

how to use: 
 - run using terminal 
 - using the "n" key, spawn in an entire group of agents
 - cycle through each mode using the numbers 1- 3
 - 1: separate mode
 - 2: cohere mode
 - 3: align mode


What we found out:

the vector2D class includes operator definitions for basic arithmetic. This means that we can combine vector2D classes with each other and in a sense, average them out. This is why I could create emergent group behaviour by combining the vector2D forces of the immediate neighbours of an agent.
