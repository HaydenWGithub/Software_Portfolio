/*
 
 - create a 2d array to reprisent the grid, use a vector containing character vectors
 - use a for loop to iterate through and print it to the console
 
 - create a variable to store the player position
 
 - if the player position matches the position of an interactable (death or gold), output accordingly
 
 -will be looking at creating a few functions, notably:
    - render() - print the board using a for loop, might want to display the player position as well eg. P
    - update() - update player position based on input from main, check position with interactables
    - something else to check what directions the player can move?
 - will call these function inside a loop in main
